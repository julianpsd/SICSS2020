# SICSS2020 

## Description

This is a repository for a group project developed during the 2020 Summer Institute in Computational Social Sciences.
This project analyses 1% of the tweets posted in Canada between March and May 2020 mentioning the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess the topics and sentiment of these tweets. 
Furthermore, we compared this data with existing statistics on the number of cases, deaths, and the effects of COVID-19 in the job market. Our project assessed the correlations between these variables and the sentiment of the tweets.
